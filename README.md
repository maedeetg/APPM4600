This repo contains the work completed for Lab 1 for APPM 4600

The goal of this lab was to learn basic commands and skills in Python, like plotting and practical code design. 

In terms of plotting, I have produced `Figure_1` and `Figure_2`, which are plots of numpy arrays using `np.arange` and `linspace.` `lab1_3.2_Exercies` contains the code to produce plots `Figure_1` and `Figure_2.`

To practice practical code design, I created lab1.py and built a `driver()` and two subroutines. The subroutines in `lab1.py` compute the dot product, `dotProduct(x, y, n)` of two vectors of length $n$ and compute matrix-vector multiplication, `matrix_mult(A, B).` The driver computes dot products and matrix multiplication using the subroutines I created versus numpy functions.
